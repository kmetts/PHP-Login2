PHP-Login2
==========
Hey Guys,

This is a Web Page login script written in PHP. To use it, you will need to build a MySQL database on your server. You will need your
database fields to match those that are mentioned in the php files. You will then open up login.php and replace USERNAME and PASSWORD in that file with the username and password
of the database that you created.
